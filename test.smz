inspired by electric blues, chuck berry introduced an aggressive guitar sound to 
rock and roll, and established the electric guitar as its centrepiece,[34] adapting his 
rock band instrumentation from the basic blues band instrumentation of a lead guitar, 
second chord instrument, bass and drums.
louis, memphis, new york city, detroit, 
chicago, cleveland, and buffalo (see: second great migration (african american)) meant 
that black and white residents were living in close proximity in larger numbers than ever 
before, and as a result heard each other's music and even began to emulate each other's 
fashions.
[20] there is general agreement that it arose in the southern united states – 
a region that would produce most of the major early rock and roll acts – through the 
meeting of various influences that embodied a merging of the african musical tradition 
with european instrumentation.
rock 'n' roll, keith richards 
proposes that chuck berry developed his brand of rock and roll by transposing the familiar 
two-note lead line of jump blues piano directly to the electric guitar, creating what is 
instantly recognizable as rock guitar.
[11] classic rock 
and roll is usually played with one or two electric guitars (one lead, one rhythm), a 
double bass (string bass) or after the mid-1950s an electric bass guitar, and a drum kit.
commentators differ in their views 
of which of these forms were most important and the degree to which the new
music was a re-branding of african-american rhythm and blues for a white market, or a new 
hybrid of black and white forms.
there were also changes in the record industry, with the rise of independent labels like 
atlantic, sun and chess servicing niche audiences and a similar rise of radio stations 
that played their music.
in the 1930s, jazz, and particularly swing, both in urban- based dance bands and 
blues-influenced country swing (jimmie rodgers, moon mullican and other similar singers), 
were among the first music to present african- american sounds for a predominantly white 
audience.
[44] however, the use of distortion was predated by 
electric blues guitarists such as joe hill louis,[45] guitar slim,[46] willie johnson of 
howlin' wolf's band,[47] and pat hare; the latter two also made use of distorted power 
chords in the early 1950s.
[22][23] radio stations that made white and black forms of music available to 
both groups, the development and spread of the gramophone record, and african-american 
musical styles such as jazz and swing which were taken up by white musicians, aided this 
process of.
one particularly noteworthy example of a jazz song with recognizably rock and 
roll elements is big joe turner with pianist pete johnson's 1939 single roll 'em pete,
which is regarded as an important precursor of rock and roll.
during and immediately after world war ii, with shortages of fuel and 
limitations on audiences and available personnel, large jazz bands were less economical 
and tended to be replaced by smaller combos, using guitars, bass and drums.

not a commercial success until the following year, is generally recognized as an important 
milestone, but it was preceded by many recordings from earlier decades in which elements 
of rock and roll can be clearly discerned.

and his delta cats (ike turner and his band the kings of rhythm), recorded by sam phillips 
for sun records in march 1951.
[20][33] in the 
same period, particularly on the west coast and in the midwest, the development of jump 
blues, with its guitar riffs, prominent beats and shouted lyrics, prefigured many later 
developments.
various gospel, blues and swing 
recordings used the phrase before it became used more frequently – but still 
intermittently – in the 1940s, on recordings and in reviews of what became known as.
in the earliest rock and roll styles, either the piano or saxophone was typically the 
lead instrument, but these instruments were generally replaced or supplemented by guitar 
in the middle to late 1950s.
other artists with early rock and roll hits included chuck berry, bo diddley, 
little richard, jerry lee lewis, and gene vincent.

ocean,[15] but by the early 20th century was used both to describe the spiritual fervor 
of black church rituals[16] and as a sexual analogy.
[18] in 1951, cleveland, ohio, disc jockey 
alan freed began playing this music style while popularizing the phrase to describe it.
